# Social Media Web Application
## This application demonstrates the use of Cloudflare Workers and KV to make posts for everyone to see. The application was for hands-on practice with Cloudflares services, needless to say, Cloudflare provides ease when needing to develop and host applications.
### Below is the website to add posts to the social media web app!

When running the code locally:<br>
(1) Go to the directory in terminal where the toml file is and run the command line:
wrangler dev <br>

This will provide a local url for developers to see changes they've made to code. <br>

(2) Another way to run is by going to the directory in terminal where the toml file is and run the command line:
wrangler publish<br>

This will give the developer a preview of how their web application looks like, but without the real-time changes they make on the code.
